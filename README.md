# React Real Estate App

## How to start the Assignment

- Fork and clone the project
- Go to root directory and run "npm install"
- run the app "npm run dev"

## Necessary Info

- Remember to do one step at a time and follow the order of the tasks.
- You can use CSS/Bootstrap/Tailwind/MUI etc. for styling.

## A. Basic Requirements

### A1. JSX, Functional Components

1. Create a simple React component: "Property" to display a property listing with details like title, location, image, and price using JSX and JavaScript expressions.

2. Break the UI into reusable functional components: Split the property details into separate components (PropertyTitle, PropertyLocation, PropertyPrice, PropertyImage) and compose them in the Property component.

3. Style your components: Apply CSS or any styling framework to make the property listing visually appealing.

### A2. Props, Mapping, Conditional Rendering

1. Pass data between components using props and destructuring: Pass property data (e.g., title, location, price, imageUrl) as props and destructure them inside each component.

2. Mapping Components: Dynamically render components by Creating an array of properties and render a list of property cards by mapping over the array.

3. Conditional Rendering: if the array had no property then display some helpful message to the User.

### A3. Event Handling, useState Hook, Controlled Component

1. Create Property: Implement a form component "AddPropertyForm" that allows users to create a new property.

2. Delete Property: Remove a property from the list.

3. Deployment: Deploy the real estate app using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages

## B. Additional Requirements

### B1. Layout, Validation

1. Create a responsive basic layout for the app: Implement a common layout that includes a header, footer, and a main content area where different components will be rendered.

2. Form Validation: Add validation to ensure proper data entry (e.g., price must be a number, location cannot be empty). Feel free to use any 3rd party library such as yuk, useForm etc.

### B2. React Router

1. Implement client-side routing using React Router: Add multiple routes for different pages (e.g., "Property List", "Add Property", "Edit Property", "Login").

2. Authentication and Protected Routes: Protect certain routes in the app using authentication. If the user is not logged in send them to the Login page before accessing a protected route.

## C. Bonus Requirements

1. Persist Data Using Local Storage: Persist the property list between page reloads using localStorage.
2. Update Property: Edit an existing propertyâ€™s details.
